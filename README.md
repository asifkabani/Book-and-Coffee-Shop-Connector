### Summary
The purpose of the Books n Brew app is to connect someone with an e-book and a coffee shop. Maybe someone ends up in a new city with some spare time. They could search for a book and then find the nearest coffee shop to read at. The app can provide driving and walking directions to the coffee shop they find.
